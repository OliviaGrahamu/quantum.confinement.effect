Quantum confinement effect in quantum dots
⚛️ Concept
In bulk semiconductors, bandgap Eg​ is fixed.
But in nanoparticles (quantum dots), the bandgap widens as size shrinks (quantum confinement).
A simplified Brus equation (effective mass approximation) for the bandgap is:

📊 What this app does:
Models CdSe quantum dots (a common nanomaterial).
Shows how bandgap energy increases as radius decreases.
Produces a graph:
X-axis = radius of quantum dot (nm).
Y-axis = bandgap energy (eV).
Bulk bandgap shown as a red dashed line.
